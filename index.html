          <h4>New School Canteen</h4>

            My school canteen was not really big and only children’s items were offered, yet that canteen holds the most special place in my heart even above than a five-star hotel. From the spicy foods to the sweets, cold drinks, lassi, chocolates, and pudding, every possible item for kids was available in my school canteen. As a kid, we thought that non-veg dishes are the most delicious dishes and once we even ordered in the canteen but we ended up getting a rebuke. Our school canteen didn’t offer non-veg foods considering the health factor of children. Being in a small area, it always looked crowded but was never suffocating because there were windows from all sides.Tables and chairs were set in a row with a sufficient space so that students could enjoy their meal. Even though I daily carried my lunch box along,I always had my meal at the canteen with my friends. I don’t know whether it was the relax-free life, the never-to-be-forgotten ambiance of canteen or the love of friends but as much I enjoyed the meal in my canteen, I couldn’t enjoy it anywhere till today.

          <h4>Implement Online Attendance System</h4>  
           <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/10/4f/8d/104f8d2da0cc97402be97c0c25588f26.png" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
           <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
            The main disadvantages of these traditional systems are as follows;
Online student feedback is limited
In traditional classrooms, teachers can give students immediate face-to-face feedback. Students who are experiencing problems in the curriculum can resolve them quickly and directly either during the lecture or during the dedicated office hours. Personalized feedback has a positive impact on students, as it makes learning processes easier, richer, and more significant, all the while raising the motivation levels of the students.

E-Learning, on the other hand, still tends to struggle with student feedback. Students completing regular assessments become dissatisfied when they experience a lack of personalized feedback. The traditional methods of providing student feedback don’t always work in an E-Learning environment, and because of this, online education providers are forced to look towards alternative methods for providing feedback. Providing student feedback in an online setting is still a relatively unresearched topic area, and it might take a while for any specific strategies to become fully research-based and proven to be effective.

Solution: Researchers have demonstrated successful examples of peer feedback systems in online learning, which could be a potential solution to the problem of limited student feedback in e-learning. Additionally, this disadvantage of E-Learning is sometimes solved through video chats with professors, which function similarly to the professor’s office hours during on-campus training.
